YouTube Clone Project

This was a project that I needed to work on for a web development course. The course only focused on HTML and some basic CSS at the time.

We are using the HTML and CSS project as part of our initial GitHub experience and maximizing our VS Code experience.

We will hopefully add some JS to it to spice it up soon - but I'm not sure yet. :)
